This tool is a lightweight, open-source simulator for studying how noise assumptions affect Quantum Error Correction (QEC) performance. The question that it seeks to answer is: _How sensitive are QEC results to specific noise models?_

### What it does
  - This tool applies independent bit flip noise at rate _p_ to a repetition code of length _n_
  - It decodes using majority-vote
  - It sweeps _p_ across a range which you can configure and estimates logical error rate with Monte Carlo estimation model
  - This tool computes the exact analytical baseline using the binomial distribution model
  - It will output a plot with both curves and an absolute error subplot (log-scaled) to validate the agreement

Most QEC tools are held to large institutions or require significant setup. This tool runs from the command line and has no other dependencies, being fully reproducible with fixed seed.

## Getting Started:
### Installation:
Make sure to download/update latest versions of pip, python, git, and related packages prior to running this simulation for best/optimal results. Once complete, proceed with installation instructions.

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JitheshMithra/QECops.git
cd QECops
```
Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Running the simulation:
All simulations are executed from the src directory
```bash
#example simulation:
cd src
python -m QECops.plot --n 3 5 7 --trials 20000 --seed 0 --logicalbit 0 --pmin 0.0 --pmax 0.2 --pstep 0.02
```
Command Line arguments:
  - --n: one or more ODD repetition-code lengths
  - --trials: # of Monte Carlo trials per data point
  - --logicalbit: Logical bit to encode (0 or 1)
  - --pmin, --pmax, --pstep: Physical error rate sweep parameters
  - --seed: Random seed for reproducibility
### Output:
Each run will generate timestamped results directory which contains:
  - plot.png: Static plot containing LER vs_p_, Monte Carlo + Analytical results, absolute error subplot
  - plot.html: interactive Plotly html graph, useful for visualization and analytical curve
  - QECops_noise_results.txt: Table numerical values

These outputs provide a direct comparison between simulation and analytical predictions, including quantitative validation through the absolute error subplot.

### Noise Model and Assumptions:
- Independent, uncorrelated bit flip noise (for now)
- Classical repetition code with majority vote decoding
- Analytical baseline from the binomial distribution

This tool takes a noise assumption as input and shows you what error correction looks like under that assumption, it does not implement new codes or claim theoretical thresholds. It does not model hardware directly.

### Limitations:
- Noise is assumed to be independent, no correlated or biased errors YET
- Only repetition codes and majority-vote decoding are currently supported
- Does not connect with real hardware
- Assumes product-state initialization (|0...0⟩)
- Uses a simplified bit-flip noise model
- Does not yet model full quantum states
- Not a circuit-level noise model

**Future additions (v2 plans):**
  - Extended noise models (biased, correlated)
  - Log scale plots for Monte Carlo (users can plot LER on a log scale, clear error suppression, effective distance scaling)
  - Seed control per-p (use rng across entire sweep, improves statistical independence and interpretation)
  - Parameter sweeps BEYOND p 
  - Optional saving results as JSON or CSV
  - Switch from absolute error analysis to relative error analysis for better comparing in low probability regions
  - Superposition states (e.g., Bell, GHZ)
  - Density matrixes
  - Circuit-level noise modeling
  - Exploring more advanced QEC codes using tools like [Stim](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim)
